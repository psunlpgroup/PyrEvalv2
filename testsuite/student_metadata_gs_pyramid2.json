The roller coaster should have a huge initial drop leading right with a loop going upside down because it will bring excitement to the ride but also safe because you know you will have potential energy to make it over the loop. We measured this in are experiment by playing around with different heights for the drop we found that a meter drop worked the best and stored enough potential energy to the loop following right after. We know this will be safe for the riders because the roller carts will be able to carry kilograms but it wont be to heavy to not make it over certain obstacles. Continuing through the ride there will be hill after the loop to make sure it is not at a out of control speed so it safe, there will be a mini drop after the hill to give the riders a break then the riders will go down a huge thrilling drop extending lower to the ground for the final big drop continuing with another loop and going backwards. We will end the ride with a slower ending in a straight line to ensure the safe stop and to slow down the potential energy a bit more. Mass does not affect speed, so the mass should be 55 kg so the roller coaster can have more total energy."}

The relationship between PE and KE is inverse. This means that when one goes up the other goes down. For example, in our experiment when the drop height was at the highest point the potential energy was at Joules and the Kinetic energy was at , but when the cart started going down the hill the PE went down to at the bottom and the KE increased the Joules because energy cant not be created nor destroyed so it transferred to kinetic. When the mass of the cart is higher the PE and KE increase. This is happening b c something with a greater mass can move at a greater speed so since they are able to move faster the PE and KE increase due to more energy. When the drop height is higher it creates more energy and has enough energy built up that it can go over a hill at almost the same height. The mass of the car has a lot to do with the car's energy, but it has nothing to do with the speed of the car. I also found that height directly affects speed, so as height goes up, speed also goes up."}

The higher the drop height will allow for increased amounts of potential energy. Potential energy will allow the roller coaster to accelerate faster and make it more exciting. From my first trial, I found that with an initial drop height of m, the car had , J of potential energy at the top and , J of kinetic energy at the bottom. When I increased the initial drop height to m, the car had , J of potential energy and , J of kinetic energy at the bottom. Therefore, to allow for the roller coaster to go faster, m will be the best option for the drop height. Since this roller coaster is used in a frictionless environment, the potential energy kinetic energy will always equal the same thing. The only energy involved will be mechanical energy because there is no force of friction acting upon the objects. Due to this, as the roller coaster goes down the hill, all the potential energy will convert into kinetic energy. Similarly, as the car goes up the hill, the kinetic energy will convert into potential energy. As such, the total energy will remain the same throughout. We know this because of the law of conservation of energy. Another thing to take into consideration is the hill height in regards to the initial drop height. Due to the frictionless environment, the hill height can be anything less than our initial drop height of m. As such, we decided that a hill height of .m will be the best. As the car goes up the hill, the kinetic energy converts back into potential energy. Since our initial drop height was greater than .m, it will have enough potential energy to get up the hill. In my first trial, I found that a hill height of m with an initial drop of m, would have , J of potential energy, but it would not be enough to get over the hill. But, with the same initial drop height of m and , J of potential energy, we would be able to get over a hill of .m with J of kinetic energy left over. Lastly, we need to take into consideration the mass of the car. I think that a car with a mass of kg will be the best for this roller coaster. I found that a car with a greater amount of mass will result in a greater amount of potential energy at the top of the initial drop. In my first trial, a car of kg resulted in , J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, and , J of kinetic energy at the bottom.

The more height there is the more PE at the bottom and KE at the bottom. PE and KE both relate to the height and mass of the roller coaster. The more height the more PE and KE and total energy, also as the cart on the roller coaster get near the bottom there will be more KE than PE. If there is more height, there also is more mass, if there is more mass there is more than likely more PE and KE. If there is a huge roller coaster then there is more PE and KE at the bottom. When the roller coaster is going down the PE and KE are going to rise because they are getting closer to the bottom. If the cart on the roller coaster was at the top there would be an equal amount of PE, but not KE based on the data that I took. Also if the drop was high but the hills were higher, then the car wouldn't have an easy time going through the whole track being able to get to the bottom. So you would need to have the drop be higher than all of the hills so it would have enough force to go through all of the track. I think there should be a drop height of m. Because based on my data if there is a higher drop than the hills on the track the car should be able to make it through the tracks. The law of conversation of energy also states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only transform into another. This means that, in general, the mass of a roller coaster car will not have an impact on its speed."}

When my simulation had the drop height of m it gave me the most PE and KE out of my trials. If you were to compare my first trial to my last it would be m high with the PE of the initial drop being J and for my last trial, it would be m high with the PE at the top of the initial drop being J. The higher the height of the drop the more PE there will be at the top and the more KE there will be at the bottom, so I recommend making the drop height high enough so it can release enough PE to make it to the end of the coaster. PE and KE relationship relies on the amount of energy that is given. If you have a J of PE at the top of the hill then that same amount of energy would transfer to the KE at the bottom of the hill. Energy cannot be created or destroyed but it can change, this has to do with the PE and KE because the amount of PE that you have when you go down a hill transfers over to the KE at the bottom so no energy is gained or lost as the car goes down the hill. The more mass a car has the more PE and total energy it is going to have. When I compared the mass of a kg car the PE was J at the top and at the bottom, the KE was J, but when my car had a mass of kg the PE was J at the top and the KE at the bottom was J. So the more mass the car has the more potential energy it will start with and the more kinetic energy it will end with.So for the Gonzales family to have the best roller coaster they need to include a high drop height in order to build up all that potential and kinetic energy so that the roller coaster makes it through the turns and to the end. The higher the initial drop, the faster the car goes."}

The height of the initial drop relates to the potential energy at the top and the kinetic energy at the bottom because the higher the drop the more the potential energy and kinetic energy are going to be. For example, when the drop height was . the potential energy at the start was and the kinetic energy at the bottom was Jules. And when the drop was . the potential energy at the start was and the kinetic energy at the bottom was . The relationship between potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy is that potential energy kinetic energy at the bottom is equal to the total energy which is the same as the potential energy at the start because no energy can be lost or gained. The change in potential energy and kinetic energy going down the hill is that at the top of the hill there is still more potential energy than kinetic energy but as it goes down the hill the potential energy turns into kinetic energy so there is now more kinetic energy than the potential energy going down the hill. The law of conservation is that no energy can be lost or gained so because no energy can be lost or gained the energy transfers from potential energy to kinetic energy or kinetic energy to potential instead of disappearing it turns into a different type of energy. If the drop height is lower than the hill then the car will not make it up the hill without being pulled up. And the more mass the car has the more energy it will have. For example, when the mass was the total energy was , and when the mass was the total energy was showing that the more mass you have the more energy you will have.

First, the ride is obviously terrifying but it is a ride where you have no time to think about anything it is what it sounds like terrifying so it will bring a lot of fun, and in the end, people might want to go again! But to get into some data we found that if the cart is kg then the KE will be around at the bottom of the drop, so if we do sharp twists and turns then you will gain KE preventing the cart from stopping in the middle of the track. We found that every kg added to the cart's mass then it gains around more KE. We wouldn't want it to stop in the middle of the track so that helps it from doing so. The changes of going down the drop between KE and PE would be gaining the KE and the PE would be making it through the whole ride gaining the PE and KE preventing stops or loss of speed throughout, we are trying to calculate the total mass that the cart can hold without stops or speed loss which we are testing with heavy mannequins increasing the mass and seeing if the speed continues to go down or rise calculating the mass that the cart's capacity. The drop and hill heights will first be a huge drop at the start getting a lot of suspensions but then there will be a loop and after hills and drops getting gradually smaller and smaller preventing the cart from losing the speed we need it at, we will make many drops and hills but all throughout they will get smaller and smaller. I hope you at least think about the proposal and I think this will be a big start for your amusement park's popularity! Hope you think about the proposal!"}

In my research I've concluded that my current design The G Overloader is the perfect design for maximum excitement and still being able to function. The reason my design functions is because it has a very initial drop that will carry it through the rest of the ride. With this design it has many loops which in a way gives it more potential energy for the next loop, they even get smaller to make sure that you can go on the next loop despite the loss of energy due to friction. The massive drop height give the car a lot of potential energy to go through the entire ride so through the ride the energy can transfer between potential energy and kinetic energy. As the ride starts the amount of potential energy we have transfers to kinetic energy and the kinetic energy transfers into heat energy because of friction. Height and mass work in similar ways like when you have a higher mass or height you get more energy and less height or mass less energy. For example when my mass was kilograms the total energy was joules and when the mass was kilograms the total energy was joules of energy. It was very similar when we changed height. When the height was the total energy was joules and when the height of the drop was the total energy was joules. With this information I carefully constructed this Roller Coaster.

Now as the car goes down the drop the potential energy will start to convert to KE, but the total energy will not change because energy cannot be created nor destroyed. Now we have to add a hill to the ride, but the hill cannot be higher or the same as the initial drop otherwise the car will not make it over the hill. For example, when the drop was . meters high and the hill was also . meters, the car did not make it over the hill. But when the hill was . meters high the car successfully made it over the hill. Finally, the Gonzales family should have a high drop and a hill that is no higher than the drop so the roller coaster can be fun and successful.

Scream is a ride that is safe but fun at the same time, Scream is a roller coaster that is well thought out and makes a lot of sense in building, and let me tell you why. The cart in my roller coaster holds kg, the more mass that you fir in the car the more potential and kinetic energy that you will have so having kg will create a high amount of potential and kinetic energy. which equals out two grown adults. You first start out going straight forward smoothly while you are feet in the air. You start to creep over the edge and see a huge drop you then start flying down and the potential energy you had before is now turning into kinetic you're going so fast you can barely tell where you are. All of a sudden you go up into a loop and away this is safe is that you have the over the shoulder seat belts so that you won't fall out of the cart and the loop is smaller than the initial drop so there is no reason for getting stuck upside down while you are in it. After you make your way around the loop you then get to the next hill from the loop you have slowed down and then start slowly going up the hill you then are making your way to the top and then you shift gears and start going full speed down the loop is about feet in the air so you are high up but not too high up while then you get to the bottom you start to slow down but no worries the ride isn't over yet, you start to have a little jerk of speed and go up a really small hill but its only feet in the air. Then you start to slow down and come down to a flat surface which then the potential energy that you had at the top then transfers to the kinetic energy and the joules you had at the top are now all transferred to the bottom you now have, and you didn't even realize the ride was over cause you couldn't stop screaming."}

Armed with revolutionary technology, the very Earth around you, and science, this rollercoaster is both fun and functional. With an incredibly tall drop into a beautiful canyon, the Waverider can gain loads of potential energy from the get go. Once it starts moving, it has lots of kinetic energy to spare once the exhilarating drop is done. This is because the high drop acts as both a tool for gaining potential energy as well as it is a tool for excitement! Some of our incredibly precise trials have helped to prove this. When the height of a drop was meters, the PE at the top was J, and the KE at the bottom was J. However, when we changed it to meters, the PE shot up to J, and the KE to J. All of that helped to let us know that a high drop is definitely the way to go! When enjoying the Waverider, it's important to consider the potential, kinetic, and total energy and how it works. At the start of its tall drop, it has a lot of potential energy that goes right into kinetic energy once it goes down. Because of PE and KE's inverse relationship, when potential energy goes down, kinetic energy shoots right up. Throughout the ride, the energy fluctuates as it travels between potential and kinetic energy when the ride slows down and speeds up. However, the total energy never changes. This is due to the Law of Conservation of Energy, meaning that energy can't be created or destroyed. Even though PE and KE are constantly changing between one another, total energy always stays the same. Another aspect of enjoyment is hills because we love hills! However, implementing these into your designs can be tricky, because as the cart goes up the hill, its KE goes down and PE goes up, and if there isn't enough KE, it simply comes right back down. During our research, we found that in order to get over the hill, it needs to be shorter than the initial drop. In our research, the cart was able to pass the hill except for when the hill was not shorter than the drop. But when it was the same height or higher, it failed to have enough kinetic energy to make it over. In addition, our carts are state of the art with high masses. That helps add to the functionality of the coaster, because mass, PE, and KE have a direct relationship. When mass increases, PE increases, and so does KE. And as we know, more PE and KE is always a good thing. In this scenario, of course. Our tests prove this as well when we sent a kg cart down a drop, it's PE at the top was J and J for its KE at the bottom. This contrasts the kg cart, which had J of PE at the top and J of KE at the bottom. Therefore, our high mass carts are very helpful to the Waverider's success. When it comes to making a rollercoaster, many aspects of the design have to come into account. However, Waverider has managed to do all of this and more to create the perfect design for the Gonzales family."}

Now the relationship between the height and the initial drop of the kinetic energy at the bottom is direct because as height increases so does the kinetic energy. Now I know this is true because height affects velocity. The further you fall, the more you have to accelerate. Now height and potential energy is the same way, it is a direct relationship because of the more height the more potential energy. I know this because it's in the formula mxgxh. The relationship between potential energy and kinetic energy, and total energy is direct because the more potential energy and the more kinetic energy, the more total energy. The relationship between potential and kinetic energy. when going down the drop is different though because the potential energy at the bottom of the drop was always , according to my data. But the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop all depended on how much potential energy there was at the top of the drop, which also depended on how high the drop was. Like I said before. So now for hills, the hill always has to be lower than the initial drop. So in this case, if my initial drop was I think the best height for your hill should be . m because then you can have many hills after that. They just have to get smaller and smaller. Because if you start with J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop and then you add in a . m hill, with the potential energy of , you still have plenty of potential, and kinetic energy to get to the end. Now when talking about making it to the end of the roller coaster you have to look at the mass of the car. because if the car has a lot of mass it's going to have more potential energy and kinetic energy because they are both a direct relationship. and I know this because it's stated in both formulas, mxgxh, and mxv squared. But if you have a car with less mass it will have less potential energy and less kinetic energy. I think you should have a car with a mass of because it's between and . And then it will still have a good amount of potential and kinetic energy, so make it to the end. Now you may be wondering how do we get all of this energy, well because energy does not get created, or destroyed the energy is already there. because when the car is going down the hill, and then stops at the end it goes from kinetic energy to potential energy. A higher car mass and the speed is the same as a lower car mass."}

The height of the drop relates to the PE at the top because when you make the initial drop higher, the less kinetic energy there is so therefore it transforms into more potential energy. The KE at the bottom relates to the drop because at the bottom you can't go any faster so when you reach the bottom all of the potential energy that was used in the drop, was converted to kinetic. The changes in the PE and KE while going down this initial drop is that when going down the drop, the PE started to decrease, while the KE started to increase. For the mass of the car, I chose to make it kg so that it's right in the middle and doesn't go too fast or too slow. The relationship between mass, PE, and KE is that when the mass is greater the KE and PE are greater as well. the relationship between mass and KE is a direct relationship and the relationship between mass and PE is also direct. For the hill height, I did . m tall because since in my experiments I found out that having an initial drop height of m and a hill height of m, it didn't make it over the hill so having . I know can make the ride fun and exciting while being practical and making it to make sure it makes it through.

First, we have to think about how high the initial drop is. I think think that the initial drop should be meters tall because the higher the drop the more potential energy you will have. Potential energy and drop in height have a direct relationship. This means that when you make the hill higher you will have more potential energy. The same goes for the mass of the car. If you make the cart really heavy then the total energy will be more and the potential energy at the top of the hill will be high but not higher than the total energy. the kinetic energy at the bottom will be the same as the total energy as well.

We should make the hill height meters tall this way the passengers will be thrilled and they can make it to the top of the hill without going back down the hill. We also have to consider the friction that we will have to encounter during the ride. Friction has to be accounted for because it transfers our potential and kinetic energy into heat thermal energy so that we lose some of that kinetic energy while we are moving.

The same goes for when there is friction. 9. Let's say the initial PE at the top of a drop was 5000J, and at the bottom the KE was 4200J and the PE was only two. 10. The energy could not have been destroyed so this means that it was transferred over to thermal energy from friction. 11. The hill height should be not as high as the initial drop height because if the hill height is higher, there would not be enough KE to get over because it is taller than the initial drop height. 12. But if the hill height is shorter then there would be enough KE to make it over. 13. No matter the mass of the roller coaster car, since there is no friction on our roller coaster, the speed will always be the same."}

I believe the initial drop height should be 5 meters. 2. The PE at the beginning at 5 meters was 2443 Joules and the KE at the bottom of the roller coaster was 2443 Joules. 3. This is going to create enough speed/velocity to get us over our hills, loops, and to the end of the roller coaster since it has the most energy. 4. The relationship between PE and KE is inversely related. 5. When one of the energies goes up, the other goes down. 6. For example: At the initial drop of 5 meters, the PE was 2443 Joules because of the height and mass but there were 0 Joules of KE because the car had no speed/velocity. 7. When the roller coaster car started to go down the hill, the KE increased because it started to gain speed as the PE decreased because the roller coaster car was losing height. 8. The mass also affected the energy. 9. For example: When the height was 5 meters and the mass of the car was 40 kg, the PE, KE, and total energy throughout the ride was 1957 Joules. 10. But when the mass of the car was 60 kg, the PE, Ke, and total energy was 2936 Joules. 11. This shows us that the relationship between Mass and PE, KE, and total energy are directly related. 12. When one goes up, so does the other. 13. The relationship between the initial drop height and the hill height shows us that when the hill height is the same as the initial drop, the roller coaster car will not make it to the end of the ride."}

My team and I decided that we would like our initial drop height to be 5, the highest drop height there was. 2. When designing the roller coaster we had to think about how the drop height would affect the PE and KE. 3. We figured out that the higher the drop height the more PE and KE there would be. 4. At the drop height of 5, the PE at the top of the drop was 2834, whereas the PE at the drop height of 2 was 1134. 5. The drop height and hill height also affect how much KE there will be. 6. If the drop height is 5 and the hill height is 3 the KE at the top of the hill will be 1142. 7. But if you were to have a drop height of 5 and a hill height of 5 the KE at the top of the hill would be 37, not even enough to get the cart over the hill. 8. Staying with the topic of the initial drop, how does the PE transfer into KE going down the drop 9. If you started at the top of a drop with a height of 5, the potential energy at the top of the drop was 2834, but as the cart goes down the drop that energy transforms into KE. 10. So in the middle of the drop, the KE and PE would be 50/50, but by the time you get to the bottom of the drop, you would have 2834 joules of KE. 11. The law of conservation of energy states that no energy is lost, it is just transformed into a different kind of energy, this applies to the roller coaster because at the start the roller coaster has PE, but as it goes down it becomes KE. 12. This shows how the energy transforms into other energy. 13. The mass also affects the PE and KE, the more mass the roller coaster has the more PE and KE the coaster will have. 14. If you have a car mass of 40, the KE is 1946 and the PE is 1949. 15. But as the mass gets greater the PE and KE grow to. 16. So if you have a mass of 60, the KE is 2933 and the PE is 2938. 17.

So if I start my initial drop height at 3m the PE at the top will be 1700J and KE at 0J but if I increase the height of the initial drop height to 5m the PE will increase to 2834J and KE will stay the same, 0J. 2. The KE at the bottom of the initial height with the initial height was 3m the KE at the bottom would be 1700J and so if the initial drop was at 5m the KE at the bottom would then also increase to 2833. 3. So the higher the initial drop is the higher the PE is at the top and the higher the KE is at the bottom of the initial drop. 4. Let's say the initial drop is 5m, you would have a 2834J of PE at the top and by the time you get to the bottom you would have the same amount of energy but it would all change to KE and so the KE went from 0J to 2834J because energy can't be created or destroyed so by the end of the ride the total energy will be the same amount you started with just all KE and not PE anymore. 5. When you're at the top of the initial drop all the energy is PE and the higher you are the more PE you have, and the closer you are to the ground the more KE you have and the less PE you have. 6. When at the top of the initial drop all the energy will be PE and so when you're going down the hill that PE will start transferring into KE until you get all the way to the bottom, all the PE will be gone and it will all be KE, but the total amount of energy will still be the same amount that you started with. 7. When there is more mass in the cart the more energy you will have because you will need more energy to even start to move on the roller coaster. 8. You will have both more PE and KE and you would need more energy to get over the hill because if you had more mass but the same amount of energy you had before you would not make it over the hill after the initial drop. 9. I know this because of the relationship of height and energy, it is direct when one goes up so does the other. 10. however, the mass of the roller coaster car doesn't affect the speed."}

My recommendation would be that the drop height should be HIGHER than the hills in the roller coaster. 2. The more height there is the more PE at the bottom and KE at the bottom. 3.

The more height the more PE and KE and total energy, also as the cart on the roller coaster get near the bottom there will be more KE than PE. 5. If there is more height, there also is more mass, if there is more mass there is more than likely more PE and KE. 6. If there is a huge roller coaster then there is more PE and KE at the bottom. 7. When the roller coaster is going down the PE and KE are going to rise because they are getting closer to the bottom. 8. If the cart on the roller coaster was at the top there would be an equal amount of PE, but not KE based on the data that I took. 9. Also if the drop was high but the hills were higher, then the car wouldn't have an easy time going through the whole track being able to get to the bottom. 10. So you would need to have the drop be higher than all of the hills so it would have enough force to go through all of the track. 11. I think there should be a drop height of 5m. 12. Because based on my data if there is a higher drop than the hills on the track the car should be able to make it through the tracks. 13.

The height of the roller coaster should be somewhere between 4-and 5 meters if you want to ensure that the roller coaster will have a higher possibility of making it over the hill and the loop. 2. Because if you don't have enough initial PE the roller coaster won't make it to the end of the ride and at that point, the ride would be pointless. 3. The higher the roller coaster is the more PE it will have and it will have a greater KE at the bottom of the hill, so the height can determine if the energy amount will be small or large. 4. The PE and KE of this simulation switch depending on the height of the cart. 5. Like if the cart is at the highest point of the roller coaster there is going to be a lot of PE and no KE, but as it reaches the bottom of the roller coaster or it comes to a stop then KE will be larger. 6. In the tests we ran as the cart went down the hill the PE went down and the KE went up. 7. The law of conservation of energy states that no energy is not being created or destroyed, as the cart goes down the hill but it is being used up and slowed by friction and that is what causes the cart to come to a stop if there isn't enough force and energy to continue the cart forward. 8. The hill height is going to have to be smaller than the initial drop height otherwise the cart will not make it over the hill because it will not have enough energy to get over the hill considering the PE at the top of the hill would be less and you can't expect smaller energy to be able to top bigger energy, especially depending on the cart's mass it might not even make it halfway up the hill. 9. The mass of the cart will have a larger acceleration if it has a large drop height so the relationship between mass and height matters otherwise the roller coaster might not be operational. 10. As you can see we have been doing some deep digging into finding out what will make a roller coaster fun and operational, and most importantly, safe. 11. So as long as the roller coaster has enough mass compared to height it will be fully operational, safe, and fun for the public. 12. The higher the roller coaster is, the more speed or velocity the roller coaster car will have."}

The higher your hill is the more PE you will have at the bottom and the more KE you will have at the top, when the drop height is 2m the PE at the top is 1173J but when the drop height is 5m the PE at the top is 2932J, and with KE when the drop height is 2m the KE at the bottom is 1172J and when the drop is 5m the KE at the bottom is 2930J this just shows the relationship between the height of the hill and the PE at the top and the KE at the bottom. 2. Another relationship is PE and KE and TE. 3. The main thing about this relationship is that when you add the PE + KE you get TE, for example at the top of the drop that was 2m the PE was 1173J and the KE was 0 so 1173 + 0 = 1173J of TE and this also works at the bottom of the hill like the PE at the bottom of the hill was 1J and the KE at the bottom was 1172J so 1 + 1172 = 1173J of TE. 4. Like the law of conservation of energy says energy can't be created or destroyed, but it can be transformed into a different form of energy so when you are at the top of the drop your PE is 1173J when you are falling you have about 568J of PE and KE because the PE was transformed into KE. 5. This next relationship is my favorite it is the relationship between the drop height and the hill height it isn't my favorite because it's easy to understand it's my favorite because it was logic to it if you are testing a track formation and your drop height is 3 and your hill height is 5 you won't be able to make it over the hill because you won't have enough energy to make it over the hill but if your drop height is 5 and your hill height is 3 then you will be able to make it over the hill because you will have enough energy. 6. The final relationship I'm going to talk about is the relationship between Mass PE and KE, This one is going to be pretty simple because it says only a couple of things, the more mass you have the more energy you will have so if you are sitting at the top of the drop and your mass is 40kg and your PE at the top of the drop is 1932J you will have less energy than if your mass was 60kg because the more mass you have the more energy you will have this goes for PE and KE. 7. Thanks for listening to my essay about these relationships that I have learned about in the last few days. 8. As a team, we have decided that the mass of the car affects does not affect the speed of the roller coaster."}

When I made the height 2m I saw that the Pe was only 1,134J. 6. T the bottom the KE was 1700. 7. This drop height would be enough to go over more hills and go as fast. 8. The relationship between PE and KE is direct. 9. When the PE at the top of the hill is going down it is transferred into the Ke causing one to go up and the other to go down. 10. The relationship between TE and PE and KE is always direct. 11. When the PE at the top goes up the TE also goes up. 12. Same at the bottom the KE and the bottom goes up so does the TE. 13. The changes in the PE and KE get transferred. 14. For example When I set the hill height at 4 and the initial; drop at 5. 15. Pe at the top of the hill was not the same as it was at the bottom. 16. The PE at the top of the initial drop was 2448J and the Pe at the top of the hill was 1922J. 17. The energy gets transferred when the car is moving and not moving. 18.

During the MAss and energy experiment, I saw that when I put the car mass at 50kg I saw that the Pe at the initial drop was 2446J but the Ke and the bottom of the drop were 2430J. 20. Those numbers should be the same so why weren't they? 21. the energy was transferred into sound energy, heat energy. 22. Thi si called friction. 23. The car mass should be 40kg. 24.

When we put the initial drop at 5 and the hill height and five found that the cart didn't make it over. 27. The total energy would make it go. 28.

Based on my data the initial drop height should be 5m this is because when I put the initial drop at 2m the amount of potential energy at the beginning was 1110J and for Kinetic energy it was 1110J at the end of the drop. 2. When I did 5m though the amount of potential energy increased to 2775J and for kinetic energy, it increased to 2775J at the end of the drop. 3. this means that the more height there is the more total energy there is. 4. In the simulation where there is no friction, the relationship between potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy was that the amount of total energy was the same as the amount of potential energy at the beginning and the total energy was the same as the kinetic energy at the end. 5. this means that the amount of energy should stay the same. 6. When I was testing the initial drop for the rollercoaster I saw that cart started with 2775J of potential energy and 0J of kinetic energy, as the cart went down the drop it lost potential energy and it converted into kinetic energy so at the end of the drop the cart had 0J of potential energy and 2775J of kinetic energy. 7. This is because the law of conservation of energy states that energy can't be created or destroyed but it can convert into other types of energy and that is what is happening in the model. 8. This then leads me to the relationship between drop and hill height. 9. When I was testing in the simulation I found out that the hill has to be shorter than the initial drop height. 10. When I put the hill height at 2m and the initial drop at 5m the cart had no problem with getting over the hill but when I put the hill height at 5m and the initial drop at 5m the cart did not make it to the end of the ride. 11. Finally, when I tested different masses of the cart I noticed that the more mass there was the more PE there was at the start of the ride and more kinetic energy at the end of the ride. 12. when I tested it I put the mass of the cart at 40kg and the amount of potential energy was 1957J and the start and 1957J of kinetic energy at the end but when I tested the cart at 60kg the amount of potential energy was 2936J at the start and 2936J of kinetic energy at the end of the ride. 13. This then means that the amount of weight in the cart should be around 60kg."}

The initial drop height should be 5 meters, we found that height directly relates to the potential energy at the top and kinetic energy at the bottom. 2. This is proven when you look at the data we collected, for example, a 2-meter drop has an initial pe of 1173J and at the bottom, the kinetic energy was 1172J and for a 5 meter drop the potential energy at the top was 2932J and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2931J. 3. Another recommendation is the hill being below the height of the initial drop this is because when we had the hill height just below the initial drop height the kinetic energy at the top was 291J which is much less than when we had the hill at 2 meters which had a kinetic energy of 1765J at the top of the hill. 4. This is because as you go down the hill you lose pe and gain kinetic energy but when you go up the hill you lose kinetic energy and gain pe this is because potential energy and kinetic energy are inversely related however they are both directly related to total energy this is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy which states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed however it can be transferred from one type to another. 5. My last recommendation is that the roller coaster car has a mass of 60kg this is because if you want to maximize your pe and kinetic energy you need more mass because they are directly related. 6. For example, a car with a mass of 40 kg has an initial pe of 1957J and kinetic energy at the bottom of 1938J and for a 60kg car the initial pe is 2933J, and kinetic energy at the bottom is 2906J. 7.

Your drop height should be 3 meters because the higher the initial drop height the higher the PE will be at the start. 2. And if you have a higher PE while your ride is going more PE will be transferred into KE which the more KE you have the farther and faster the ride will be able to go. 3. Like in one of my trials when I started with a lower height like 2m I only had 973J of PE which made the KE only increase u to 972J while the ride ended. 4. Then in another trial, I started with an initial drop of 2.5m so I had 1216J of PE and at the end, I had 1215J of KE. 5. The Higher the initial drop is again the higher the PE will be at the start and because there is no KE at the top the Total energy will always stay at 973J. 6. This is according to the law of conservation of energy, energy can not be created or destroyed. 7. The total amount of PE and KE added up will be the same the whole ride. 8. So because the PE is high at the top of the drop and the KE is high at the bottom energy and can never be created or destroyed the PE transfers over into KE during the ride Causing the PE to decrease and the KE to increase. 9. But the initial height isn't the only thing that impacts the height the car mass also does. 10. The more mass the car has the height the PE will be at the beginning which would lead to more KE. 11. So the more mass the more PE which means More KE. 12. At the top of the hill, you will have a certain PE, and if you add a hill that is lower than the initial drop height your car will be able to make it over the hill because the PE will be able to transfer over into enough KE to make it over the hill. 13. But if you had a hill that was higher then Initial drop the PE at the start will not be able to transfer into enough ke to make it over the hill. 14. I know this because in my first trial I started with an initial drop of 3 and a hill height of 2 and the car was able to make it over. 15. But in my third trial I also had an initial drop of 3 but I also had heel height of 3 and the car was not able to make it over the hill."}

The height of the drop relates to PE at the top because they have a direct relationship, the larger the height the bigger the PE. 2. Also, KE and height have a direct relationship so when the car is at the bottom the KE will be bigger if the drop height is bigger. 3. In my simulation when the drop height was 4 the PE was 2267 Joules and the KE was 2266, but when the drop height was 5 the PE was 2834 joules and the KE was 2833. 4. The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is when the Car is at the top of the initial drop the PE is always the same as the total energy and the KE is always 0. 5. When the car is at the bottom of the drop the KE is the amount of the total energy if there is no friction, but if there is some of the energy gets turned into nonusable energy and KE is less than the starting total energy. 6. When the car is at the bottom the PE is always 0. 7. The changes in PE and KE going down the drop is when the car starts accelerating it changes from PE to KE. 8. The energy from PE doesn't get destroyed it gets converted into KE. 9. That's why at the top of the drop the PE is the total energy and the KE is 0 and at the bottom of the drop the PE is 0 and the KE is the total energy or total energy that is usable. 10. Energy transformation happens when the PE converts to KE this is because The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. 11. So when the car goes down the hill the energy changes from PE to KE. 12. The relationship between the drop height in hill height is that the initial drop has to be higher than the hill. 13. In the simulation, I found that when I had both the initial drop and hill height at 5 the KE was only 29 joules at the top of the hill and it wasn't enough to make it over. 14. But when the hill height was 4 and the drop height was 5 the KE was 559 at the top of the hill and was able to make it over. 15. This shows the hill height must be less than the initial drop. 16. The relationship between mass PE and KE is when the Mass is more the total energy is more. 17. In the simulation, I found that when the car mass was 50 the PE at the top of the hill ( total energy ) was only 2449 Joules and the KE at the bottom was 2444 joules. 18. But when the mass was 60 the PE at the top of the hill was 2938 Joules and the KE at the bottom of the hill was 2895 joules. 19. This shows that mass and energy have a direct relationship."}

The height of the initial drop should be 5 meters because the potential energy 2443 J is and the other heights are less potential energy. 2. Also, according to the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed so when the potential energy decrease as it goes down the hill the energy will transfer to kinetic energy and will increase the speed of the car so it has a better chance of making it to end. 3. Potential, Kinetic, and Total energy all affect the ride because potential energy which is stored energy will be the starting amount of energy, and since energy cannot be created or destroyed also means that it will also be the total energy at the beginning and the end of the ride since at the moment the car is not moving so there is no kinetic energy. 4. Then as the car moves potential energy transfers to kinetic energy since it is now moving but will still have the same amount of total energy because none of the energy will go away. 5. Potential energy and kinetic energy change throughout the whole ride, at the initial drop there is only stored energy or PE so there will be no Kinetic energy at the start. 6. Then as the car goes in motion there will be less stored energy and more energy of motion so potential energy will transfer to kinetic energy and so the PE will decrease and the KE will increase. 7. I think the hill should be 2 meters because it will have the most kinetic energy to keep it going, there will be 1462J of kinetic energy which is more than all of the other trials. 8. When the drop height is 5 meters that will give you the most potential energy which also will then transfer into more kinetic energy as it moves, but if you add a hill the PE and KE will change a little bit more throughout the ride. 9. If you want a rollercoaster to be fun and exciting usually you add hills and loops and you need as much potential energy and kinetic energy as you can get. 10. 2 meters will give you 1462J of kinetic energy at the top of the hill which will give you enough kinetic energy to make it over the hill and add more hills and loops to make the rollercoaster more fun. 11. I also think the mass of the car should be 60 kilograms because it gives 2936J of potential energy at the top and 2930J of kinetic energy as it is in motion.The masses that are less than 60kg all had less potential and kinetic energy so they wouldn't make it as far as the 60kg car and when you add loops and hills you need as much kinetic energy as you can get so that the car will make it to the end. 12. The more mass there is the more potential energy you start off with to get more kinetic energy as it moves. 13.

The more mass the more pe and ke it has. 14. So the relationship between ke and mass is a direct and so is the relationship between mass and pe. 15. When the car mass was 60 kg it had 2933 joules of pe and had 2900 joules of ke.But when the mass of the car was 40 kg it had 1955 joules of pe and had 1950 joules of ke."}

The initial drop height should be 5 m because there will be more energy that will allow the cart to make it to the end of the roller coaster. 2. When I was doing the initial drop trials I first had the height at 5 m, the potential energy at the top was 2443 J, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2442 J. 3. When I had the drop height at 3 m the potential energy at the top was 1466 J, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1465 J. 4. This shows that the higher the height is the more potential energy it has at the start and the more kinetic energy it has at the bottom of the roller coaster. 5. The law of conservation of energy says that energy can be transferred but not created nor destroyed. 6. Potential energy and kinetic energy transform back and forth into each other throughout the roller coaster. 7. In my initial drop trial, the potential energy at the top of the drop at 4 m was 1955 J, the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop was 1954 J, and the total energy was 1955 J. 8. This shows that the potential energy transformed into kinetic energy throughout the roller coaster, and the total energy stayed the same. 9. When the cart is going down the initial drop some of the potential energy starts changing into kinetic energy. 10. During my add a hill trial where I had the hill height at 3, the PE at the top of the hill was 1472 J and the KE was 975 J. 11. This shows that the potential energy had started changing into kinetic energy when it went down the initial drop. 12. The hill height should be between 2-4 m because the hill height needs to be smaller than the initial drop height so the cart will be able to make it to the end. 13. The mass of the cart should be 50 kg so the cart can make it to the end of the roller coaster. 14. When I had the mass at 50 kg the PE was 2446 J at the top of the drop and the KE at the bottom was 2442 J. 15. This shows that when the cart has more mass there will be more potential energy at the top of the drop. 16. And when the cart has a higher mass there will be more kinetic energy at the end as well."}

I think the initial drop height should be 5 meters this is because when the height of the initial drop was 3 meters the PE was 1466 J and at the bottom, the Ke was 1466, but when the Release height was 4 meters the PE was 1955 J and the Ke at the bottom of the initial drop was 1955 meaning the car had more energy the higher the drop and the more speed it will have to get over hills witch make the run more exciting. 2. We should also add a hill no more than 5 meters or else it will stop according to my data. 3. When the initial drop was 5 meters and the hill height was 5 meters the cart did not make it to the end. 4. This is because The Law of Conservation of Energy says, energy is not created nor destroyed energy only changes forms. 5. So the cart will not be able to just make energy to push itself above the 5 meters. 6. When the initial drop height was 4 the PE was 1955 J and the KE was 0 J at the bottom, the KE was 1955 J and the PE was 0. 7. The total energy stayed the same in 1955 so there for the cart's energy stayed the same making it impossible to make it up the hill if it was the same height as the initial drop. 8. We believe we should also add a loop for more excitement, this will work as long as the apex of the loop is lower in height (meters) this is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. 9. We also believe that The Mass of the car should be 60 kg, this is because the more mass an object has the more energy(J) it has. 10. For example, when the mass of the car was 50 kg the Total energy was 2446, but when the car was 60 kg the Total energy was 2936. 11. Our data shows that when the initial drop is higher the speed increases."}

As we take a look at our data from recent studies, my best bet for the initial drop is for the hill to be much bigger than some other obstacles. 2. With a bigger drop the more potential energy build-up we'll have in order to get through hills and loops. 3. The more potential energy you have within the roller coaster also gives the kinetic energy a good chance of helping more. 4. Adding on to make this more clear PE is potential energy and KE is kinetic energy, when you have a larger drop the more PE you'll have and less KE you'll have as well. 5. When your coaster drops the KE and PE will essentially switch, meaning the PE will be transferred to KE and anything taken away most likely turn into sound and heat energy because the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can't be made or destroyed so it has to go somewhere else, if we take a look at my data for the initial drop we can see how in hill heigh 5 the PE starts as 2443 Joules, and KE starts as 0 Joules. 6. When the coaster drops the PE transfers to KE thus making KE 2442 Joules and PE 1 Joule. 7. The relationship between the hill drop and hill height can play a big difference in a roller coaster and how far it gets on its own for the Gonzales. 8. When we look at the data I've recorded throughout my simulation, hill 3 got over the hill with 1468 Joules PE and 0 Joules KE, passing through the hill it had a PE of 1467 Joules and KE again of 0 Joules, it did, in fact, make it over the hill. 9. On hill 4 the PE was 2265 Joules and KE of 0 Joules having one failed attempt and 1 good attempt, and on the hill, it was 1356 Joules and KE was 912 Joules. 10. You can tell that with a higher hill height and smaller drop height the cart usually has a harder time going over. 11. With a few non-recorded data rows, I can say that usually with a hill heigh being bigger than the drop heigh, you won't have enough potential energy to get over the hill sometimes. 12. Moving on to Mass relation with PE and KE, My group recorded data on masses 40k, 50kg, and 60kg. 13. 40kg had a PE of 1957 Joules, 50kg had a PE of 2446 Joules, and 60kg had a PE of 2938 Joules. 14. With a heavier cart, the potential energy goes up and the total energy at the end of each is 1957J for 40kg, 2446J for 50kg and 2935J for 60kg. 15. This shows how the best option if you wanted a faster idea would be 60kg for a cart mass. 16. The higher the initial drop, the more speed the car will have. 17. The mass of the car can really be any mass, from 40-60 kg, because the mass actually does not affect the speed."}

The initial drop height should be 3 meters because it won't produce that much energy but it will produce enough to make the ride enjoyable. 2. If you have a higher drop height the more energy you will have. 3. The height relates to PE at the top because when I started with an initial drop of 3 meters the PE was 1759 joules. 4. As roller coaster went down, the KE went up. 5. PE and KE have a indirect relationship. 6. At the top of the initial drop with 3 meters I had 1759 joules of PE and 0 joules of KE. 7. As the roller coaster went down I only had 1 joule of PE and 1173 joules of KE. 8. My total energy was 1173 joules. 9. This shows that the PE at the top and KE at the bottom equal the total energy. 10. The Law of Conservation of Energy states energy cannot be created or destroyed. 11. For example if I started off at the top of the rollercoaster with 100 joules of PE, halfway down the rollercoasater I would have 50 joules of PE and 50 joules of KE and at the end of the rollercoaster I would have 100 joules of just KE. 12. No energy was being created or destroyed the energy just transferred into a different form. 13. The more mass you have, the more energy you will have too. 14. My car mass was 40 kg and my total energy released was 1957 joules. 15. Then I changed my car mass to 60 kg and my total energy released was 2446 joules."}

At the beginning of the roller coaster, the drop height needs to be 5m. 2. The higher the drop height will allow for increased amounts of potential energy. 3. Potential energy will allow the roller coaster to accelerate faster and make it more exciting. 4. From my first trial, I found that with an initial drop height of 2m, the car had 1,134 J of potential energy at the top and 1,134 J of kinetic energy at the bottom. 5. When I increased the initial drop height to 5m, the car had 2,834 J of potential energy and 2,834 J of kinetic energy at the bottom. 6. Therefore, to allow for the roller coaster to go faster, 5m will be the best option for the drop height. 7. Since this roller coaster is used in a frictionless environment, the potential energy + kinetic energy will always equal the same thing. 8. The only energy involved will be mechanical energy because there is no force of friction acting upon the objects. 9. Due to this, as the roller coaster goes down the hill, all the potential energy will convert into kinetic energy. 10. Similarly, as the car goes up the hill, the kinetic energy will convert into potential energy. 11. As such, the total energy will remain the same throughout. 12. We know this because of the law of conservation of energy. 13. Another thing to take into consideration is the hill height in regards to the initial drop height. 14. Due to the frictionless environment, the hill height can be anything less than our initial drop height of 5m. 15. As such, we decided that a hill height of 4.75m will be the best. 16. As the car goes up the hill, the kinetic energy converts back into potential energy. 17. Since our initial drop height was greater than 4.75m, it will have enough potential energy to get up the hill. 18. In my first trial, I found that a hill height of 5m with an initial drop of 5m, would have 2,838 J of potential energy, but it would not be enough to get over the hill. 19. But, with the same initial drop height of 5m and 2,838 J of potential energy, we would be able to get over a hill of 4.75m with 135 J of kinetic energy left over. 20. Lastly, we need to take into consideration the mass of the car. 21. I think that a car with a mass of 60 kg will be the best for this roller coaster. 22. I found that a car with a greater amount of mass will result in a greater amount of potential energy at the top of the initial drop. 23. In my first trial, a car of 40 kg resulted in 1,955 J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, and 1,955 J of kinetic energy at the bottom. 24. But, when I used a car with 60 kg it resulted in 2,932 J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, and 2,932 J of kinetic energy at the bottom. 25. The more mass we use, the more total energy there will be resulting in a faster more exciting roller coaster. 26. Also, this proves that height and speed are directly related because the higher I made the initial drop, the more speed the coaster had."}

The initial drop height should be 5m, because when the initial drop height is at 3, the pe is much lower than the pe at a drop height of 5. 2. As you know when there is more pe the more ke the roller coaster will have when it is in motion. 3. When the cart is at the bottom the pe is lower than the ke, and when the cart is at the top the pe is at 2500 and the ke is 0. 4. But when its at the bottom its at 0.(depending on how high off the ground the tracks are) about 0 and the ke is at 2500. 5. Pe and ke are added together to find the total energy. 6. But that doesn't work when there's friction, so you also need to account other things into the total energy, like heat, sound and friction energy. 7. Keep in mind that the energy doesn't disappear. 8. So energy cannot be created nor destroyed just like mass. 9. instead it transfers into friction and ke and pe and all other things it can transfer into. 10. Changes in pe and ke happens almost always when there is a change in height like when at the initial drop the pe is for example 2500 and the ke is at 0 and then the cart starts to move then the ke goes slightly up and the pe goes down, the energy is transferring when the cart is going down. 11. And when the mass of the cat is higher the faster the cart will move downhill due to inertia. 12. So it will go faster. 13. Also the higher the initial drop height the higher the pe will be and the faster the ride will be which is hopefully what you want. 14. I learned that the higher the initial drop height the more speed it will have at the bottom. 15. This means mass does not affect the speed in a frictionless environment."}

If height changes then PE at the top of the hill and KE at the bottom of the hill will change because the higher the ground you are the more PE you will have and depending on if there is friction or not there will be the same amount of KE as well. 2. The total energy is PE and KE added together if there is fiction but if there is no friction it is just the consistent number at the top or bottom of the run. 3. The PE and KE will evenly change so %50 down the run the PE and KE will be the same and at the end, the KE will be greater and at the top, the PE will be greater. 4. Energy can neither be created or destroyed. 5. drop height and hill height are the same. 6.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "essay_energy.mass.3.235@test.com", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "MS", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "O"}, "essay_text": "1. The first recommendation that I would make, is that they make the initial drop height 5 m. 2. I would make this recommendation, because when the initial drop height is 5 m, the PE at the top of the drop is 2834 J, and the KE at the bottom of the hill is 2833 J. 3. Whereas if the initial drop height were 2 m tall, the PE at the top of the drop, would only be 1134 J, and the KE at the bottom of the drop would only be 1133 J. 4. I think this proves that if you want more energy to keep your cart going to the end of the roller coaster, you want the highest initial drop height, which would be 5 m. 5. Adding on to what I said about the amount of KE and PE, since the track is frictionless, in this simulation, the PE and KE combined will always equal the total energy, so for the initial drop, since there were 2834 J of PE at the top of it when it was 5 m. tall, and 0 J of KE at that height, the total energy would end up being the two of those added together, which equals 2834 J. 6. As the cart heads down the drop, all that PE at the top of the drop will decrease, and the amount of KE will increase. 7. This means that PE and KE, have an inverse relationship, since when one of those values increases, the other decreases, and vice versa. 8. But, since the law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, the PE, does not just disappear, and the KE is not just created. 9. The PE from the top of the drop transfers itself into KE, as it makes its way down the drop. 10. Meaning no energy is created or destroyed, it has just changed forms. 11. However, in a real-life scenario, the track would have friction. 12. This means that some of that PE, that transferred into KE in the frictionless track scenario, would transfer into thermal energy. 13. It might seem like it is losing energy, but the friction of the track is really just causing it to change into a different form, then what you might see in the simulation with the frictionless track. 14. The second recommendation I would make is to make the hill height 3 m. 15. I would make this recommendation because, based on the data that was collected, the hill height has to be smaller than the initial drop height. 16. For example, when we put the hill height at 2 m. and the initial drop height at 5 m. the cart easily made it to the end, and over the hill, and at the top of the hill, the amount of KE was 1743 J. 17. However, when we kept the initial drop height at 5 m. and put the hill height at 5 m. also, the cart did not make it to the end or over the hill, and the KE at the top of the hill was only 1 J. 18. This shows that the hill height should be shorter than the initial drop height, and I think that 3 m. would be a really good height for the hill, since it is shorter than the initial drop height of 5 m. and it has more PE at the top, causing for a more fun ride going down the hill. 19. The final recommendation that I would make is to put the mass of the car at 60 kg. 20. I would recommend this because it causes there to be more energy. 21. When the mass of the car was at 40 kg. 22. The total energy was 1957 J, and that was also the PE at the top of the initial drop, and at the bottom of the drop, the KE was 1954 J. 23. However, after changing the mass to 60 kg. 24. The total energy increased a lot to 2936 J, which was also the PE at the top of the initial drop, and the KE at the bottom of the initial drop was 2911 J. 25. This data shows, that the more mass you have, the more energy the car will have to make it to the end, and still be safe and fun."}
