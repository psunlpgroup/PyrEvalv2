As the car goes down the initial drop, the potential energy decreases while the kinetic energy increases, causing the roller coaster to move.
As the car goes up the hill, the kinetic energy turns into potential energy, to be used while going down the hill.
The potential energy decreases as you go down the roller coaster and the kinetic energy increases.
As the car goes down the initial drop, the potential energy decreases while the kinetic energy increases, causing the roller coaster to move.
The amount of potential energy decreases at the bottom of the drop and the amount of kinetic energy increased when the car went down.
This suggests that the initial drop should be higher than the hill for the car to make it over the hill.
the height of the initial drop was higher than the hills and loop afterwards
When you add a hill you want the height of that to be less than the initial drop.
In order for the car to reach back over the hill after the initial drop, the hill height has to be lower than the initial drop height.
The hill can not be higher than the initial drop,
According to the law of conservation of energy, you can not create energy, so we can not create more kinetic energy for the car.
This brings in total energy, because the law of conservation states that energy cant be created nor destroyed.
The Law of Conservation of Energy says that energy cant be created nor destroyed,
since the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can not be created nor destroyed.
The Law of conservation of Energy states that energy can be transformed into other kinds of energy but can not be created or destroyed.
This shows that the more mass of the car you have, the greater total energy.
The more mass the more energy you have.
This means that when the car has more mass it has more energy.
When theres more total energy caused by more mass in a cart,.
We noticed that the higher the amount of mass the car has, the more total, potential, and kinetic energy it had.
This shows in my data where the PE and KE never add up to more than the total number energy.
So potential energy plus kinetic energy equals the total energy of the roller coaster.
the total amount of energy stayed the same.
The total energy, however, stays the same.
The energy always added up to be the same total amount.
When another roller coaster was dropped from a lower height such as meters, the potential energy was only calculated to Joules.
the higher the drop the more potential energy will have at the top KE.
The taller the initial drop, the more potential energy the roller coaster has.
So the higher the drop the more potential energy.
At the initial drop, the potential energy depends on the height.
the potential energy at the initial drop is J.
, the potential energy turns into kinetic energy.
At the top of the initial drop, there is potential energy PE.
This potential energy from the initial drop converts into kinetic energy.
when i was testing the carts mass
When I tested out a kilogram car
When I set the car mass to kg
When setting the mass of the cart to kg
You can see we start at the top of the initial drop, with Joules of PE.
The PE at the top of the initial drop was J, and the
The potential energy at the initial drop was J,.
In trial, it shows us that the PE at the top of the Initial drop is J
And, the kinetic energy turns once again, into potential energy, to be used while going down the hill.
The kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop,, was J, some of the energy was still potential energy.
, but it can convert into different types, such as potential, kinetic, sound, heat.
This potential energy from the initial drop converts into kinetic energy.
which keeps the roller coaster moving
all of this information on the physics behind roller coasters, and what it does and does not allow them to do
Now talking about the actual roller coaster car, we need to pick how heavy it is.
as showed in my data when the roller coaster was dropped from
Setting the hill height to m and the initial drop to m, there was J of potential energy at the initial drop and J of kinetic energy.
when I changed the hill height to meters
m and made the hill height to.
when I made the initial drop height meters tall
And, the kinetic energy turns once again, into potential energy, to be used while going down the hill.
The kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop,, was J, some of the energy was still potential energy.
, but it can convert into different types, such as potential, kinetic, sound, heat.
This potential energy from the initial drop converts into kinetic energy.
A heavier mass of the cart results in higher potential energy, making the speed and KE larger than if you were to use a cart with a smaller mass.
The less mass the less energy you have,
To throw in more confusion, you have to consider the mass of the car.
This means that the car should have a lot of mass, because it will then have more PE and KE, meaning it can move faster and for a longer amount of time.
The potential energy decreases the amount from the initial drop to the top of the hill.
The total energy was J. And the initial drop did give enough energy to go over the hill.
This potential energy from the initial drop converts into kinetic energy.
A hill cant require more kinetic energy to climb than the initial drop gives,.
because, the potential energy turns into kinetic energy, making the car be able to climb higher hills, go for longer, and go faster
Thats because as you lose height the potential energy decreases while the kinetic energy increases.
KE is transferred from PE when the potential for energy decreases as you go down the roller coaster.
Because there wont be enough kinetic energy to get you over, and we know that the potential energy converts to kinetic energy.
It is important to have more potential energy,.
when the energy is transferred to KE as the potential for energy
So potential energy plus kinetic energy equals the total energy an object has.
, but it can convert into different types, such as potential, kinetic, sound, heat.
Total energy tells us that while the roller coaster runs, the potential energy transfers to kinetic energy.
We used potential energy to our advantage when we designed our roller coaster.
, the roller coaster car easily made it over the hill with still enough potential energy to get to the end.
But was J.
Thats a J difference!
and the KE was J.
At the bottom of the initial drop, there is Joules of KE.
the PE at the initial drop was J, and the KE at the bottom was J, the total energy was J.
when setting the height to m and the initial drop at m, the potential energy at the initial drop was J and the kinetic energy
You can see we start at the top of the initial drop, with Joules of PE.
the higher your initial drop is the more PE you have at the top.
We also have to make a reasonable sized car, to generate the most PE at the start of the initial drop.
when you add hills
As the car goes up the hill
When you add a hill
, with a car mass of kg, we had a total energy of J.
the potential energy was J,.
The total energy was J.
Setting the hill height to m and the initial drop to m, there was J of potential energy at the initial drop and J of kinetic energy.
But when I set the mass of the car to kg, the PE at the initial drop was J, and the KE at the bottom was, the total was J.
For example, with a car mass of kg, we had a total energy of J. But
I have found that height and potential energy have a direct relationship.
The higher the initial height the more potential energy is present.
Height affects the amount of potential energy.
At the top of the hill, the potential energy was J and the kinetic energy was J.
, it had a potential energy of and a kinetic energy.
Once the car starts going down the hill, the potential energy converts to kinetic energy
In one of my tests, I had my initial drop set at meters.
At the initial drop, the potential energy depends on the height.
Firstly, I strongly recommend an initial drop height of meters tall.
This means that, the potential energy will also go up.
Throughout the ride the energy will just keep switching between potential and kinetic energy.
Since kinetic energy and potential energy have an inverse relationship, which means when one goes up the other goes down.
The total energy limit for the roller coaster is the PE that is calculated before the ride starts.
You have to have enough kinetic energy for the cart to get over the hill and to make it to the end of the track.
, you get your total energy, which at all times in the ride will be the same.
Now talking about the actual roller coaster car, we need to pick how heavy it is.
We can build a roller coaster with many twists, turns, ups, downs, and hills as we want,
which keeps the roller coaster moving
While a cart with a smaller mass such as my second trial, kg, results in only J at the end of the ride.
when setting the mass of the cart to kg
When I tested out a kilogram car
In another one of my experiments, I found out that mass and kinetic energy, and mass and potential energy are directly related.
This means that the energy will still be there, it will just be transferred from PE to KE.
But in this experiment we did nt use sound or heat energy.
The more weight added to an object the more energy it has.
it gathers which gives it more kinetic energy
A heavier mass of the cart results in higher potential energy, making the speed and KE larger.
You can see this in my test where I tried out a kilogram car, resulting in a potential energy of and a kinetic energy of.
At the top of the hill, the potential energy was J and the kinetic energy was J.
My first trial shows that the cart mass is kg and results in J of potential energy compared to my second trial with kg mass of the car, resulting in only J of energy in the roller coaster ride.
Dear Gonzales family, Your idea to build another roller coaster to attract more people was excellent.
Mass affects potential energy by collecting more total energy used by the roller coaster cart.
Considering all of this information on the physics behind roller coasters, and.
This shows in my data when in the data for the initial drop, it visualizes that the PE and KE never go above the total number of energy.
Based off my experiments, I have found that height and potential energy have a direct relationship, meaning that as the height goes up, the potential energy will also go up.
While not all things are possible with only the power from the initial drop, but there are definitely things we can work around.
This means that the energy will still be there, it will just be transferred from PE to KE.
Total energy tells us that while the roller coaster runs, the PE is transferring and not being created then destroyed then created again after going down this roller coaster.
When you add up how much PE and KE you have, you get your total energy, which at all times in the ride will be the same, because the Law of Conservation of Energy.
and the KE at the bottom was, the total was J.
m, there was only J PE, and did nt make it over the hill.
At the top of the hill, the potential energy was J,.
And throughout the ride the energy will just keep switching between potential and kinetic energy.
while the kinetic energy was J
In another one of my experiments, I found out that mass and kinetic energy, and mass and potential energy are directly related.

Dear Gonzales family, Your idea to build another roller coaster to attract more people was excellent.
To throw in more confusion, you have to consider the mass of the car.
Resulting in a larger KE than compared to a cart with a smaller mass.
This means that the car should have a lot of mass, because it will then have more PE and KE, meaning it can move faster and for a longer amount of time.
I have recently taken up your challenge to build a thrilling yet safe roller coaster.
With of all this, you can see roller coasters can be thrilling while keeping everyone safe.
that energy transfers to KE
This means that the energy will still be there, it will just be transferred from PE to KE.
You also have to consider the mass of the car.
This means that the car should have a lot of mass,.
We suggest a roller coaster design.
We also tested different masses of the roller coaster car.
When setting the mass of the cart at kg
i noticed that the more weight the cart is the more energy there is.
the PE will be because the two have a direct relationship
The relationship between mass and KE is the same as mass and PE.
When the hill height and the initial drop were equal
The PE at the initial drop was J,
But at the bottom of the drop the PE was J and the KE was J.
Its not perfect bottom of the drop, but its close.
as showed in my data
Since from my data, I learned that the higher up the car was
, the potential energy was calculated up to Joules.
At the end of all of these trials centered around kinetic and potential energy, we can observe that the sum of both at any given point is always the amount of total energy.
The less mass the less energy you have.
I found out that mass and total energy are directly related.
When you add multiple hills, the next hill height always has to be less than the previous hill height to sustain the movement of the car.
because it will then have more PE and KE, meaning it can move faster and for a longer amount of time
the cart was not able to get over the hill and to the end.
or the car wont be able to get over it.
If we look at our trials
Our data from testing this proves this.
Dear Gonzales family, Your idea to build another roller coaster to attract more people was excellent.
Mass affects potential energy by collecting more total energy used by the roller coaster cart.
I suggest adding a hill of about meters or less in height.
I would recommend the height of the roller coaster be meters off the ground.
a roller coaster design that has lots of ups and downs, twists and turns, and spins, and is very unpredictable
When the roller coaster was dropped from meters
I suggest making the car kilograms.
, the more PE the car had.
but we have to be smart about it.
We made sure.
Thank you, Gonzales family for offering this fun challenge,
And with the unpredictability we can say that this ride will be very fun and exciting to ride, and attract lots of customers!

Roller coasters can be fun and exciting while being safe at the same time.
As you can see at all times
because we werent always able to time it perfectly and stop at the exact
since the cart was sitting still
While a cart with a smaller mass such as my second trial, kg, results in only J at the end of the ride.

Roller coasters can be fun and exciting while being safe at the same time.
When you add up how much PE and KE you have
This means that the car should have a lot of mass,.
While the cart travels down the tracks about halfway through the energies are about.
This is a J difference between the car mass for each roller coaster ride.

that energy always almost fully transfers
as the car goes up the hill
And it made it over the hill.
which gives you more PE and KE to help you
and I hope my results have helped you!

and I hope my results have helped you!
A heavier mass of the cart results in higher potential energy.
If we look at our trials we can notice that the higher the release height is, the higher the PE will be because the two have a direct relationship.
Thank you, Gonzales family for offering this fun challenge, and I hope my results have helped you!
we can notice that the higher the release height is, the higher.
you want the height of that to be less than the initial drop.
The relationship between PE and KE remains the same throughout the ride.
Roller coasters can be fun and exciting while being safe at the same time.
This gets a little more complicated.
This gets a little more complicated when you add hills.
When you add up how much PE and KE you have, you get your total energy, which at all times in the ride will be the same.
We that, and spins, and
Our data from testing this proves this.
Now talking about the actual roller coaster car, we need to pick how heavy it is.
I suggest making the car kilograms.
When you add up how much PE and KE you have
The relationship between mass and KE is the same as mass and PE.
We that, and, and is very unpredictable
This gets a little more complicated when you add hills.
, the kinetic energy turns into potential energy, to be used while going down the hill.
The less mass the less energy you have.
Thats a J difference!
We also have to make a reasonable sized car, to generate the most PE at the start of the initial drop.
When setting the mass of the cart at kg, but the potential energy was J, which shows a significant increase.
And with the unpredictability we can say that this ride will be very fun and exciting to ride, and attract lots of customers!
The relationship between mass and KE is almost the same as mass and PE.
This is demonstrated in my data because when I made the initial drop height meters tall, the potential energy the car had at the top of it was joules.
This shows in my data in trial one when the car mass was set to kg,
But this gets a little more complicated when you add hills.
The relationship between PE and KE relates to each other after and before the roller coaster starts.
The amount of potential energy decreases at the bottom of the drop since the cart was slightly off the ground, now it was at J.
the potential energy at the initial drop is J
But when I set the mass of the car to kg, the PE at the initial drop was J, and the KE at the bottom was, the total was J.
This shows in the data I collected in trial two when I dropped the roller coaster at.
m, and the potential energy was calculated up to J, and.
The amount of potential energy decreases at the bottom of the drop since the cart was slightly off the ground, now it was at J.
But there is not enough kinetic energy still left at the top of the hill it is not able to get over, so when the hill height and the initial drop were equal the cart was not able to get over the hill and to the end.
Setting the hill height to m and the initial drop to m, there was J of potential energy at the initial drop and J of kinetic energy.
Thank you, Gonzales family for offering this fun challenge, and I hope my results have helped you!
m off the ground when making their roller coaster.
