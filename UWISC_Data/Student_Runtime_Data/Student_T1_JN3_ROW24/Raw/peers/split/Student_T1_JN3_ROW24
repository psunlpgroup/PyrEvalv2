My recommendation would be that the initial drop height should be very high so it has enough potential energy that will transfer into kinetic energy going down the hill.
When the drop height is higher it creates more energy and has enough energy built up that it can go over a hill at almost the same height.
The more height there is the more PE at the bottom and KE at the bottom.
PE and KE both relate to the height and mass of the roller coaster.
The more height the more PE and KE and total energy, also as the cart on the roller coaster get near the bottom there will be more KE than PE.
If there is more height, there also is more mass, if there is more mass there is more than likely more PE and KE.
If there is a huge roller coaster then there is more PE and KE at the bottom.
When the roller coaster is going down the PE and KE are going to rise because they are getting closer to the bottom.
If the cart on the roller coaster was at the top there would be an equal amount of PE, but not KE based on the data that I took.
Also if the drop was high but the hills were higher, then the car wouldnt have an easy time going through the whole track being able to get to the bottom.
So you would need to have the drop be higher than all of the hills so it would have enough force to go through all of the track.
I think there should be a drop height of m. Because based on my data if there is a higher drop than the hills on the track the car should be able to make it through the tracks.
The law of conversation of energy also states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only transform into another form.
