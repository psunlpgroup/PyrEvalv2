The height we found best was having the Initial drop height at meters so it has enough potential energy that will transfer into kinetic energy going down the hill which is meters high that will continue to transfer back into potential going up the hill.
The relationship between PE and KE is inverse.
This means that when one goes up the other goes down.
For example, in our experiment when the drop height was at the highest point the potential energy was at Joules and the Kinetic energy was at , but when the cart started going down the hill the PE went down to at the bottom and the KE increased the Joules because energy cant not be created nor destroyed so it transferred to kinetic.
When the mass of the cart is higher the PE and KE increase.
This is happening b c something with a greater mass can move at a greater speed so since they are able to move faster the PE and KE increase due to more energy.
When the drop height is higher it creates more energy and has enough energy built up that it can go over a hill at almost the same height.
